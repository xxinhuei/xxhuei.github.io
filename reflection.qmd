# Reflection

## How I used GenAI
I used ChatGPT to troubleshoot a GitHub authentication issue on my laptop. My local Git was linked to a different GitHub account, so I kept getting a “permission denied” error when pushing.

## What ChatGPT helped me do
ChatGPT guided me to:
- check the remote repository URL (`git remote -v`)
- clear cached credentials in my computer
- push again

Without fixing this, I would not have been able to push my Quarto website to GitHub.Therefore I needed help from chatgpt. 

## What I learned
how to solve issues like this. how to check credentials. how to create this project.
