# Reflection on using GenAI

## How I used GenAI
I used GenAI to help me understand the lab instructions and structure the Quarto website files.

## What GenAI was good at
- Explaining steps clearly
- Helping me debug Git/GitHub issues
- Generating starter templates for Quarto pages

## Limitations / what I still had to do myself
- I still needed to set up my own GitHub repo properly
- I had to verify outputs by rendering and checking the result
- I needed to write my own real project content

## What I learned
I learned how Quarto renders `.qmd` files into a website and how the `docs/` output folder is used for GitHub Pages.
